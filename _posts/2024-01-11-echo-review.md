# Overall Score

> 6/10 

Echo is fine. Its unimportant in the grand calculus of the MCU and but its not strong enough to stand by itself. 
But the more I think about it, I dislike this show more

> 5/10 Don't watch it.

# Really Strong Start

Episode 1 of Echo is amazing and sets up a lot of promise. I loved how we revisit the scenes of Hawkeye which (in my mind) was light, goofy, and funny. In Hawkeye's world, the good guys always win and is forgiven even when you're an edgy Ronin. The enemies sillyly color code themselves and wear uniforms in freaking Track Suits. But from Maya's PoV its a dark world where it is kill or be killed. I can't begin to empathise with the hardships as she is Native American, deaf, an amputee, AND a woman. 

Then there's a short yet breathtaking fight with Daredevil and boy do I miss a good daredevil fight sequence. *The blind vs The deaf*. At this moment I realized that its unfair that Matt's hearing is enhanced but Maya's vision isn't. But its fine. She's a badass even without any power. Just like Kate Bishop, That girl in Moon Knight (Scarlet something?) and Black Widows, there is no need to over explain why a woman can do what they do. Then they ruined it by giving her power via inheritence.

# Native America Culture

Echo is MCU's first [**Spotlight**](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Spotlight) meaning it is supposed to be character-driven and story heavy. 
Maya is Native American, deaf, an amputee, and a woman so they made sure there's a story for each. 
- [x] Woman - Ass grope scene by the bounces in ep.1
- [x] Deaf - Amazing music/audio mixing/ sound effects.
- [x] Amputee - Her prosthetic broke. 
- [x] Native American - Ancestral Ability
But these do not take consider the weirdness of the MCU-616 Universe. For example, in a world where Iron Man exist so wouldn't prosthetic techology be *that* much more advanced? This was even more jarring when Fisk gave Maya a contact lens that was able to translate speech into virtual reality ASL. [**Prosthetic Eye**](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Thor%27s_Prosthetic_Eye) even exist in this universe. Suspending my disbelief is hard. 

Aside from this, as a person, a character, Her growth was pretty much already complete in Hawkeye, with her freedom from Fisk. I don't think she grew at all here so Echo just feels like an aftercredits of Hawkeye. The series was her reconnecting with her ancestry and if anything, we learnt that life wasn't THAT bad for her as she had a friend and grandmother but she just refused to reach out to them. 

# Power 

In the final episode, it was revealed that her power is some kind of Ancestral Power. The full extent of her skills are unknown but currently it includes the power of healing (I assume she can't just heal her leg) and power sharing leadership shenanigans (maybe only to her bloodline?). I do not like this ability and thought it was weird so I looked at her [**Original Power**](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Maya_Lopez_(Earth-616)#Powers) which is Photographic Reflexes like Taskmaster. So apparently she does have heightened visual in the form of Incredible lip reading abilities. I love her Comic616 power SO MUCH MORE.

I am not a fan of inherited power. Mostly because this power exist in the real world in the form of $$$. I hope I opened your eye that these type of power is just a different form of capitalism you should be *shamed* if you like capitalism. This is also the reason why I don't like sons of something like Skaar, Daken, etc. However, I love Miles, Falcon, Ironfist, etc where the title is a mantle given to random people who Earned it. 

# Cast  

Everyone is amazing. Great acting. Alaqua Cox & Vincent D'Onofrio has great chemistry. Not sure what else to say about the cast. They're all amazing.

# Its not for me

In the end, there are way to many things I find issue with so I simply don't think this show is made for someone like me. They need to change so many things to cater my likings but I'm still looking forward to see Maya in Daredevil.

> Spoiler TL;DW Fisk is Alive, just as crazy, and wants to be the Major or New York
