# Overall Score

> 9/10 It's great.

## Watching Condition
Marathoned it. Tried putting it on the 2nd screen as I play Genshin but ended up putting it on the 1st screen as it got more intense.

# Nostalgia

I watched the original Mr. & Mrs. Smith (back in 2005) in the cinema. Its one of those movies that defined me just because I watched it during puberty as I was still in highschool and loved it. Even back then, most movies (that I watch) are sequels, tailor made for a specific actor, or an adaptation of books. To watch something complely new for me is... fresh. My *opinions* of that movie had to go further than "Oh its better/worse than the book". 

*As I'm writing this I realized that the original movie was probably tailor made for Brangelina*. 

# Atlanta
I watched 1 season of Atlanta and loved it. The same with Smiths and its not just Donald Glover. They took alot of people from Atlanta into this show (writer, cinematography, etc), and it shows. The vibe is identical heck even the base premise is the same. Atlanta is about the daily lives of a Rapper and Smiths is about the daily lives of Superspies. They're still normal people with normal parental trauma and normal money goals. Exploring the little things that keeps us sane like Yoga, and also the boringness of doing a stakeout. Above all, the idea that everything is okay as long as you spend it with people you love.

# Cast  
Donald Glover and Maya Erskine are both hot but they're still normal people hot. Again they're hot but they're also normal. They make the world feel believable where like the stakes are  real. The trauma are real. Morality is a real question. The phones are also real. Its rare for a show to have phones and actually utilizes it to this extent.

# Cliffhanger
The season ends with a cliffhanger of sort. Its an Inception kind of cliffhanger where it doesn't really matter.
