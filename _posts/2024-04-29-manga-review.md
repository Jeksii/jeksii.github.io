# Overview 
I read a lot of manga but I don't watch any anime. 
I read them off tachiyomi and read most of them for "free"

## Hall of Fame
I love these mangas and I've re-read them a couple of times.
They are mangas that I grew up with therefore I have massive nostalia glasses.
They're not the GOAT or anything. They simply warms my heart.

| Title              | Reason           |
|:-------------------|:-----------------|
| One Piece          | Maria Anders     |
| Rave Master        | Helen Bennett    | 
| Law of Ueki        | Giovanni Rovelli | 

## Great


## Undecided
These are mangas that I'm still reading to simply pass time. They're not particularly great but do lift up the mood
This list is MASSIVE so I put it onto a spreadsheet

## Trash
I tried reading these and its TRASH.
Most of them I didn't finish because do not eat trash.
Some joseis are objectively good but I can't stomach them. but I know they're good so I won't put them here
