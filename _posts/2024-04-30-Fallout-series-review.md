# Overall Score

> 8/10 It's a great game adaptaion. Made me play Fallout76 but as far as "cinema" goes, its pretty mid

## Watching Condition
Marathoned it but I do not play the fallout games.

# Okayge
The standard for game adaptation shows are pretty low. From Resident Evil to Battleship, there are a lot of weird ones.

Arcane is praised to be one of the gratest game adaptation show but is it really one? Its definitely set in the universe with characters from the game but there's very little game mechanic (if any, IDK I don't play league). I'm not even sure how a 5v5 fight in league can happen in the Arcane world but that's a rant for another day.

Fallout delivered. It has enough game logic that it FEELS like a video game. It doesn't have the Pipboy slow time and then having the MC chomp though mountains of food, but FO76 pipboy doesn't do that anyway. It does have stimpack that heal things magically, buffout, Power Armor, just general things that only make sense in a Video Game. How people deal with death and how Lucy's obsession to reproduction its cool that this is clearly a different world. The world t hat is run under different logic and more importantly different moral standards. That is one of the core messages of fallout games and this show makes it too.

That said, my knowledge of Fallout is about how much I know about Dungeons and Dragons. I've watched a bunch of streams, youtubes, playthrough, but I have not played it myself. These games felt too massive for me to dig into and its the same reason why I haven't gotten into Dr.Who and Star Trek. I imagine its also difficult for MCU to get new viewers.

Just like how Starwars have The Mandalorian, Fallout series is the gateway drug. Or it could've been.
AFAIK there are lore differences between the Series and the Games so I'll most likely not play fallout 4 (and even more previous ones).
I'll stick to FO76.
