# Plot
A Drama show about lawyer.. company(?), lawyers and laws in the US. During the 6 Seasons, it integrated real-life events between 2017 to 2022 including the Covid Era. 

## Casts
The main character is Diane Lockhart played by the beautifuly MILF/GILF Christine Baranski. Rosse Leslie (Ygritte in GoT) is also here but her character is not the best and thankfully got retired later. Show is stacked with good actors. It has some amazing 'villains' like Andre Braugher, Matthew Perry, and Michael Sheen which creates some bitter-sweet feeling/nostalgia. It has a lot of non-white actors like UKs Cush Jumbo

## Spins
I didn't know this but apparently this shouw is a spin-off of The Good Wife. The show also spins off into [**Elsbeth**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsbeth_(TV_series))

## Real life Knowledge
I'm not a history buff but I imagine when people watch a historical show they kinda know what's gonna happen therefore somewhat immune to the plot twists. But through reddit I know American Politics and boy this show was my first time experiencing such things. How it seamlessly integrates things that happens during Trump's precidency and shows that some democrats where benefited when he won. Show also didn't skip Covid, they integrated it for better/worse. It takes a special balls to do this, most shows pretend that Covid didn't happen and I don't blame them. I want my show to emphasise on the goodness of this world, the light in the dark.

## Masturbatory
I love a story with a message. Most children book has generic message like "Be Good" or "Be Kind". James Gunn's show like Peacemaker and Guardians of the Galaxy vol.3 has a bit of "Don't be racist" message. The Good Fight has probably the most specific message which can be generalized to "Be a Democrat", "Left Wing Best Wing". I don't think I've watched a show so catered towards my view (which has been shaped by reddit lol). It's an interesting feeling

I find that pop-shows nowadays are very generic as they need to cater both ends of the spectrum and boy that spectrum is LOOOOOONG.
