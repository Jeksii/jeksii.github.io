# Overall Score
It's aight.
: ⭐⭐⭐

# Personal Warnings
- [x] Sexy John Cena ⭐
- [x] Plot Holes
- [ ] Good Casting

# Plot
A story about a group who invented an imaginary friend to take the fall whenever they need something. The things they got away from is insane. The peak of american sitcom where there are no concequences as long as we're doing it in good faith. 

## Cast
John Cena, Andrew Santino, and Zac Efron (also Jermaine Fowler the token black friend). They're a weird combo. The show opens up with their kid version and then they grew up together. Being almost 40 I have 0 contact with my neighbourhood friends so I refuse to believe that some people can have this kind of relationship. Also, if anyone, Zac Efron is supposed to be BFFs with Vanessa Hudgens.

## Flow
The movie is almost 2 hour. Its too long for a comedy movie and perhaps it should've been a series. The flow was very off the the point that I feel like this is a 3 x 40 minute episode show. Maybe its supposed to be a mini series?
