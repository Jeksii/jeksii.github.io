# Plot
I watched this because it popped up a lot in my YoutubeShorts. I'm building a habit where if I see a couple of clips, I should watch the entire show/movie.
The movie follows Chickie Donohue as he travels to Vietnam during the [**Vietnam War**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War). With his street smart he's able to sneak into military bases and other restricted areas.

## Twist
I am not American (heck I'm SEAn therefore closer to Vietnam) so I do not get the whole epiphany that the main chacater had, about how America might not be the good guys. To me, America has never been the good guys and no one is. War is messy and I'm old enough to know that even the brightest sun has a dark spot. 

## Light in the Dark
I appreciate when movies tackle dark subject aned turn it bright. War is horrible and it is journalis/news' job to objectively communicate how terrible that is. Movies on the other hand can and should put subjectivity or their work so they should emphasize the good parts. So I love that everything is very vibrant. Things are clean to the point that it feels like a set, but for the better. It is not dark and murky as the typical war show have. 

I believe this is somewhat of a hot take. I also love Thor:Ragnarok that puts tons and tons of comedy vs fighting cancer.
